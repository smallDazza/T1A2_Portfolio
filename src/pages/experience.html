            <h3>My Working Experience</h3>
            <p>For the last 15 years I have been working in two different companies inside their CS / ICT divisons.My start was in the customer service area of a company and as a trainer for clients of their software product.After around 4 years training and knowing the product very well I internally retrained and moved into the software support division.</p>
            <p>With 3 years of software support experience I moved to another company employed in the Product Development Team. The company is a division of Apotex pharmaceuticals specializing in SAAS for medication packaging.I am currently still employed as a Product Owner at this company: <a href="https://mypaksolutions.com.au" target="_blank">myPak Solutions.</a></p>
            <p>Working in this position results in me having daily meetings and conversations with the programming & development team members. This is what inspires my interest in this area and so I have decided to formally be trained in both the front and backend development. Over the years I have learnt a number skills & used the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Databases:  SQL + noSQL (Mongodb).</li>
                <li>Remote access control systems:  used Logmein, screenconnect & teamviewer.</li>
                <li>Project management tools:  mostly used JIRA.</li>
                <li>Documentation:  mostly used Confluence.</li>
                <li>Version control systems:  Used both GitHub & Bitbucket.</li>
            </ul>
