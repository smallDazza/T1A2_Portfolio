            <p>My name is Darren Small and I am a male living in Sydney, NSW. Being born and raised in the northern sydney suburbs I like to be active outdoors. I have a easy going , patient attitude and would consider myself a friendly person. In my professional life I have always worked well in teams with a focus to be involved and determined to see a job done.

            <h3>What Are My Ambitions ?</h3>
            <p>For the last 8 years i have been working in & leading a team in a companies software product development. As a product owner i have always been interested and interacted with the people in the programming / development side of the SDLC but never been formerly trained in this area. So over the last year i have decided and moved forward in being trained for persuing this direction of my professional life.</p>
            <p>My Ambition is to be employed in the full stack development area of creating applications in both the front & back end. I am inspired and love the fact that working in this industry can see you be employed almost anywhere in the world, which will hopefully combine with my love of travel and sports , fingers crossed !!</p>
            <p>Here are a number of bloggs i follow for help and training purposes:</p>
