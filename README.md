## The Design: Site Map ##
Please see this image for the website site map:

## The Design: Colour Palette ##

In all pages I have used this colour palette 'ice cream' for background, text, object colour, available from this color hex website: [ice cream color palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/660).

## The Design: Website Pages Wire Frame Layouts ##
Based on this website; [Bulma Responsiveness Breakpoints](https://bulma.io/documentation/start/responsiveness/) , I have added the 3 screen size breakpoints.

For the mobile screen layouts of the web pages:
The layout of images, objects and text for mobile screens was taking into account the smaller width <=767px, so all these items would need to appear in a portrait type of structure.

For the tablet screen layouts of the web pages:
The layout of images, objects and text for tablet screens was taking into account the width between 768px & 1023px, so all these items would need to appear in a combination of portrait and landscape type structures.

For the desktop scrteen layouts of the web pages:
The layout of images, objects and text for desktop screens was taking into account the larger width >=1024px, so all these items would need to appear in a landscape type of structure.

## Components Used In Website ##
The structure and design of the website has used both HTML 5 and CSS functions.
This is a list of components used to display some features to enhance the engagement of employers in understanding Darren Small as a person and as a valuable employee:
- a header = to display the top of the page with a title of the page the user has gone to.
- navigation bar = a section with links to navigate to other pages listed above. Using flexbox to adjust and the use of the pseudo-class 'hover' to highlight the link the user has hovered the cursor over.  
- on some pages we are using the list component to display items in a list format.
- section , article and div tags = have been used to group components to display images, background colour, backgorund images and text relating to the subject matter of each page. These are using flexbox to adjust to different screen sizes.
- footer = to display the bottom of the page with a link to the contact me page.
