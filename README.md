## Design: Website Pages Wire Frame Layouts ##
For the mobile screen layouts of the web pages:
The layout of images, objects and text for the mobile screens was taking into account the smaller width (<=767px), so all these items would need to appear in a column type structure.  

For the tablet screen layouts of the web pages:
The layout of images, objects and text for the tablet screens was taking into account the width (between 768px & 1023px), so all these items would need to appear in a combination of row and column type structure.

For the desktop scrteen layouts of the web pages:
The layout of images, objects and text for the desktop screens was taking into account the larger width (>=1024px), so all these items would need to appear in a row type structure.


## Components Used In Website ##
The structure and design of the website has used both HTML 5 and CSS functions.
This is a list of components used to display some features to enhance the engagement of employers in understanding Darren Small as a person worthy of being employed:
- a header = to display the top of the page with a title of the page the user has gone to.
- navigation bar = a section with links to navigate to other pages listed above. Using flexbox to adjust to different screen sizes and the use of the pseudo-class 'hover' to highlight the link the user have hovered the cursor over.  
- on some pages we are using the list component to display items in a list format.
- article and div tags = have been used to group components to display images and text relating to the subject matter of the page. These ares are using flexbox to adjust to different screen sizes.
- footer = to display the bottom of the page with a link to the contact me page.
